* Hyprshell

  A desktop daemon the replaces shell scripts that collected information for =eww= and other system processes. Plan on expanding it to handle anything that doesn't make since for a hyprland plugin to do.

* Daemon Actions
  - eww: get weather
  - cron notifications (reminder to fix posture and look after eyes)
  - eww: window client
  - eww: submap
** TODO eww: replace playerctrl
** TODO eww: workspaces
* Notes

** Example of how to send Signal to Daemon from client
#+begin_src go
//
obj := conn.Object(core.ServiceName, core.ServiceObjectPath)
action := core.DockSignal{Type: core.DockAction("Test"), Msg: ""}
err = obj.Call(core.ServiceInterface+"."+core.MinimizeApp, 0, action).Store()
#+end_src
